To convert logits into probabilities, we need to apply a SoftMax layer to them. As we can see, this transforms them into positive numbers that sum up to 1. The last step is to know which of those corresponds to the positive or the negative label. This is given by the id2label field of the model config. The first probabilities (index 0) correspond to the negative label, and the seconds (index 1) correspond to the positive label. This is how our classifier built with the pipeline function picked those labels and computed those scores. Now that you know how each steps works, you can easily tweak them to your needs.</td>\n",

To make sense of those logits, we need to dig into the third and last step of the pipeline: post-processing. To convert logits into probabilities, we need to apply a SoftMax layer to them. As we can see, this transforms them into positive numbers that sum up to 1. The last step is to know which of those corresponds to the positive or the negative label. This is given by the id2label field of the model config. The first probabilities (index 0) correspond to the negative label, and the seconds (index 1) correspond to the positive label. This is how our classifier built with the pipeline function picked those labels and computed those scores. Now that you know how each steps works, you can easily tweak them to your needs.   \n",
